# Introduction

## Miles Prower
Miles is sleeping on his couch again. He's been doing this since the day he got his first place. It saves space, but it gives him headaches the day after. Oh well.

His TV is idling, using that bouncing screensaver with the TV logo on it. It's been like this the entire time he's been sleeping.

Other than that, everything's completely normal to him.

## Narrator
A knock is heard on the door, followed by what seems like feet shuffling away from the door.

The buzzer rings shortly after the steps are heard departing, which wakes Miles up.

## Miles Prower
**"Agh, in a MINUTE!"** he shouts, crawling out of bed and up to get the door. **"And this late, too... What happened to calling first?"**

He opens the door, and on the other side is a package, addressed to Miles himself. **"Oh, a package. Okay."** he says, nabbing the package off of the ground and shutting the door behind him. **"...wonder what it is."**

He grabs a nearby knife... stopping after he picks it up. He observes it... there's a little bit of blood on the edge. **"...oh. right. Wrong knife."**

He takes a detour into his kitchen, to get another, cleaner knife. Then, he cuts the tape with said knife, opening up the box.

It's a box of donuts, packaged neatly in a colourful box. The address line says **"Miles Prower, 14th b."** and the return address reads **"Silver"**.

Miles pauses as he reads the word **"Silver"** on the return address.

**"...Silver? Why would he..."**

He notices the note affixed to the lid with a neat slice of tape. Miles detaches the note from the box, sitting down on his couch and setting the box on the coffee table in front of it.

He opens up the note, reading it. It has hand-drawn art, neat penmanship, the works. Miles looks these details over, smiling at all of the work put on this single piece of paper.

## Silver Blure
Hello, Miles! I sincerely hope you're alive and well while reading this. This box of donuts is for you, sir. I'm so thankful you've been found alive.

Your willingness to end it all was truly depressing to hear... I seriously wish I could have changed what you did, at least somewhat. Suicide was never the way to go, and I hope you realize that now.

I know losing one of my best friends wasn't something I wanted to go through. And I should have done more, Miles. I really really should have done more to help you.

I hope you're doing better right now. I hope you're aware there are people who care for you and love you dearly, even if it doesn't seem like it.

I'd love to see you again, Miles. Please, call me or text me. Either way, I don't care. We should arrange a hangout, if you're not busy.

Your dearest manager and friend,

- Silver Blure

## Miles Prower
Miles continues to stay silent, smiling embarrasingly. He seems to blush a little, dropping the note on the donut box and hiding his head in his hands.

**"Fuck... god damn it, he's so caring, how could I possibly..."**

Miles sighs, sitting up and taking his phone off of the coffee table. His lockscreen hits him immediately, a picture of last year's Christmas party at the burger shop with Silver.

Silver had been the manager of this burger shop for almost his entire life, after he came backwards from the future.

He threw holiday parties every year, and the last year Miles had been employed there was the best bash overall. Through these parties, Silver connected with his employees and treated them like family.

It was amazing, and a night Miles could never forget. Miles and Silver had a great dynamic with each other, and it really showed with this picture.

But, as Miles looked at the picture, he only grew sadder. What could've been. If he didn't... fuck it all up a few months later.

Looking at this picture, Miles set his phone down, contemplating if he should actually contact Silver again.

## Narrator
A chime rings from Miles' phone.

Miles looks at the phone, slowly reaching over to pick it up and read whatever dinged him.

## Silver Blure
**"Silver work - Now - Hey, Miles! I... hope you can see this. Please." >>**

## Miles Prower
Miles quickly unlocked his phone, hunching over and typing away a message.

# Introduction Part 2
> Silver's House

Characters:

## Silver Blure
Silver laid front down on his bed, silent noise coming from the television he had on. He stared at the blank canvas that was his messages with Miles.

Silver hadn't seen a shred of activity from Miles at all. His status dot was a dull, uninspiring grey. Holefully sometime - maybe even someday, the dot would turn green.

Until then, Silver sat in worry. In worry of if Miles had forgotten about him, or had... just no way to access his texts in general. He hoped the donut box he sent wasn't going stale on an empty doorstep.

Silver's stomach rumbled out of hunger. He usually tried to keep himself well-fed, but his worrying about Miles had him staring at his computer screen almost 24/7. Silver sighed, getting up and rubbing his eyes, stretching.

He walked out of his room, leaving the computer on and open as he went to hunt for some food to eat.

## Silver Blure
Opening the fridge, Silver looked into the clutter that was his fridge. He squinted in the fridge light, hoping to find something to inspire him.

A thing that caught his eye was a singular Hot Pocket, sitting there packaged in the middle of the fridge.

Silver grabbed the Hot Pocket, breaking open the seal and shutting the fridge with those mighty-useful telekinetic powers. He didn't use them for very much these days, but it is nice to have an extra hand to water more of his plants with.

As Silver opened the microwave and followed the instructions on the partially-busted seal, he looked over briefly at his plants.

He brought his focus back to the microwave then, putting the Hot Pocket smack-dab in the middle of the rotating plate and shutting it, setting the instructed time.

He looked again at his plants. The sweet and colourful patterns of the flowers, the spindling vines from some of the more mischevious plants... and hell, even their overwhelming green-ness.

These were the things that Silver loved most about his plants. They are the things that make him happy, to be able to take care of them and watch the mystical results brought by Mother Nature herself. They also make his living room smell nice.

## Narrator
Four uniform beeps echoed from the microwave, and Silver opened the microwave, grabbing the Hot Pocket from the inside with the easy carry sleeve.

He walked back to his room, waving goodbye to his plants.

## Silver Blure
Silver bit into the Hot Pocket as he laid down in front of his computer. As his eyes processed what was in front of him, he saw something.

## Miles Prower
Miles Prower is typing...

## Silver Blure
After seeing this, he dropped his Hot Pocket and stared intently at the screen. Those damn flickering dots... what message are they hiding from him?

Silver stared in a mix of shock and excitement. He hadn't heard from Miles in almost a month... and here he is, showing activity.

Maybe he got the donut box, then. Maybe he even read the note? All of these questions flooded Silver's mind as the dots simply flickered.

Then, a message.

## Miles Prower
**"hey, silver. it's been long" >>**

## Silver Blure
...Silver was a bit disappointed, but he was nonetheless thrilled to hear from Miles. The second the message appeared on the screen, Silver got to work.

He typed up his message in a blaze, dropping some letters in the process.

**<< "MUIOLES HOLYCAP????? YOUJ GOT Y nOTE????????????????????"**

Silver wasn't too happy with the spelling errors and excessive typos in his message. Taking a breather, he typed a neater message.

**<< "I'm so sorry, Miles, I got excited. Did you get my note?"**

## Miles Prower
**"excited? to see me? interesting" >>**

**"also yes i did. i liked the penmanwhatever. you're very good at that lol" >>**

## Silver Blure
Silver grabbed his Hot Pocket off of his bed, taking another bite.

**<< "Do you mean penmanship? If that's what you mean, thank you! I'm so glad you were able to get back to me, Miles."**

## Miles Prower
**"nice to see you too." >>**

Miles typed for a long time. Seeing this, Silver got... a bit confused, but he waited paitently.

Miles was never really the type to do long messages, so whatever this was, it was probably important.

**"hey, silv. i got a question for you. do you still work at the burger shop? i found a picture of the christmas party last year on my lockscreen and i thought of you." >>**

## Silver Blure
**<< "I do! Would you want to work there again? I could re-hire you, it's not *too* hard, and it would be great to have you there again."**

## Miles Prower
**"..." >>**

**"i'll think about it." >>**

**"ijust wanna go to bed, silver. see you soon" >>**

And as he sent that message, the green blip of activity transformed into a dead, dull gray.

## Silver Blure
Silver sighed, hoping to at least see him tomorrow. At this point, though, he had been lost. There was a chance he would never appear online again.

He closed his computer, not even typing a goodbye. He just sat on his bed, watching the stuff on his TV.

# Introduction Part 3
> Miles' Apartment

Characters:
- Silver Blure
- Miles Prower

## Miles Prower
Miles had fallen asleep, snoring soundly.

His phone was once in his hand, as he forgot to put it down before passing out. It ended up on the floor, vibrating slowly as it tries to tell Miles there's an alarm.

Its attempts are futile, and Miles stays asleep. Miles wanted to set an alarm tone, but he didn't like any of the ones the system came with, and he was too lazy to make his own.

Finally, a call comes through. It plays a loud ringtone, notifying Miles that someone is calling him - duh.

Miles writhes around, opening his eyes and looking around for his phone to hopefully deny the call and head back to sleep.

It's not on the coffee table, or in his hand... He looks down. It's, of course, on the floor. Miles picks up his phone, rubbing his eyes to read the screen.

## Narrator
**"Silver work is calling. Swipe up to answer - Swipe down to reject"**

## Miles Prower
**"Ah, fuck... why is he calling so early?"**

He sees the clock, immediately realizing. It's 1PM, and he's most definitely overslept. Thankfully, he has nothing to do, but if he did, he would most absolutely be late.

He decides to answer the call, putting the phone on speaker and setting it on the table.

## Silver Blure
**"Miles, hey, uh.... are you there?"**

**"Hi, it's Silver, uhh... how are you?"**

## Miles Prower
**"You sound like you're talking to yourself, Silver. I'm here."** Miles replies in the most crackly, morning-wound voice possible. He didn't mean it, but it's whatever.

**"I've been... fine, mostly. I slept through... like, half of the day."**

## Silver Blure
**"You haven't been doing anything at all? Just sleeping?"**

## Miles Prower
**"Yeah, what about it?"**

## Silver Blure
**"Nothing, you just sound so tired, and... I just called to ask if you wanted to come over to my place."**

Silver hesitates for a while, causing Miles to think he's open to talk, but just as Miles gets his first breath --

**"You know, I... got a cat, recently! Her name's Jan, and she's such a sweetheart. You should meet her, if you're not, you know... Allergic to cat dander, haha-"**

## Miles Prower
Miles waits for longer after Silver's second line, seeing if he has anything else to say.

**"Well, uh... Sure, sounds good. When... should I come over?"**

## Silver Blure
Silver gets a bit excited, and it's definitely audible through his voice.

**"Oh, oh, uh... you can come anytime today! I'll be waiting, no pressure."**

## Miles Prower
**"Aww, haha... Alright, I'll see what I can do. I'll be over as soon as possible, OK, Silver?"**

## Silver Blure
**"Niice! I can't wait to see you! It'll be fun, trust me. I have so much board games."**

## Miles Prower
**"Boo, board games, boooo... haha, I'm kidding. Sure, whatever. I'll be there, see ya."**

Miles hangs up, grabbing his phone and trying to get out of the door as soon as possible, making sure to grab his keys.
