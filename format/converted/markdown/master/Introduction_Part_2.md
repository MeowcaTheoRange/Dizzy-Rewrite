# Introduction Part 2
> Silver's House

Characters:
- Silver Blure
- Miles Prower

## Silver Blure
Silver laid front down on his bed, silent noise coming from the television he had on. He stared at the blank canvas that was his messages with Miles.

Silver hadn't seen a shred of activity from Miles at all. His status dot was a dull, uninspiring grey. Holefully sometime - maybe even someday, the dot would turn green.

Until then, Silver sat in worry. In worry of if Miles had forgotten about him, or had... just no way to access his texts in general. He hoped the donut box he sent wasn't going stale on an empty doorstep.

Silver's stomach rumbled out of hunger. He usually tried to keep himself well-fed, but his worrying about Miles had him staring at his computer screen almost 24/7. Silver sighed, getting up and rubbing his eyes, stretching.

He walked out of his room, leaving the computer on and open as he went to hunt for some food to eat.

## Silver Blure
Opening the fridge, Silver looked into the clutter that was his fridge. He squinted in the fridge light, hoping to find something to inspire him.

A thing that caught his eye was a singular Hot Pocket, sitting there packaged in the middle of the fridge.

Silver grabbed the Hot Pocket, breaking open the seal and shutting the fridge with those mighty-useful telekinetic powers. He didn't use them for very much these days, but it is nice to have an extra hand to water more of his plants with.

As Silver opened the microwave and followed the instructions on the partially-busted seal, he looked over briefly at his plants.

He brought his focus back to the microwave then, putting the Hot Pocket smack-dab in the middle of the rotating plate and shutting it, setting the instructed time.

He looked again at his plants. The sweet and colourful patterns of the flowers, the spindling vines from some of the more mischevious plants... and hell, even their overwhelming green-ness.

These were the things that Silver loved most about his plants. They are the things that make him happy, to be able to take care of them and watch the mystical results brought by Mother Nature herself. They also make his living room smell nice.

## Narrator
Four uniform beeps echoed from the microwave, and Silver opened the microwave, grabbing the Hot Pocket from the inside with the easy carry sleeve.

He walked back to his room, waving goodbye to his plants.

## Silver Blure
Silver bit into the Hot Pocket as he laid down in front of his computer. As his eyes processed what was in front of him, he saw something.

## Miles Prower
Miles Prower is typing...

## Silver Blure
After seeing this, he dropped his Hot Pocket and stared intently at the screen. Those damn flickering dots... what message are they hiding from him?

Silver stared in a mix of shock and excitement. He hadn't heard from Miles in almost a month... and here he is, showing activity.

Maybe he got the donut box, then. Maybe he even read the note? All of these questions flooded Silver's mind as the dots simply flickered.

Then, a message.

## Miles Prower
**"hey, silver. it's been long" >>**

## Silver Blure
...Silver was a bit disappointed, but he was nonetheless thrilled to hear from Miles. The second the message appeared on the screen, Silver got to work.

He typed up his message in a blaze, dropping some letters in the process.

**<< "MUIOLES HOLYCAP????? YOUJ GOT Y nOTE????????????????????"**

Silver wasn't too happy with the spelling errors and excessive typos in his message. Taking a breather, he typed a neater message.

**<< "I'm so sorry, Miles, I got excited. Did you get my note?"**

## Miles Prower
**"excited? to see me? interesting" >>**

**"also yes i did. i liked the penmanwhatever. you're very good at that lol" >>**

## Silver Blure
Silver grabbed his Hot Pocket off of his bed, taking another bite.

**<< "Do you mean penmanship? If that's what you mean, thank you! I'm so glad you were able to get back to me, Miles."**

## Miles Prower
**"nice to see you too." >>**

Miles typed for a long time. Seeing this, Silver got... a bit confused, but he waited paitently.

Miles was never really the type to do long messages, so whatever this was, it was probably important.

**"hey, silv. i got a question for you. do you still work at the burger shop? i found a picture of the christmas party last year on my lockscreen and i thought of you." >>**

## Silver Blure
**<< "I do! Would you want to work there again? I could re-hire you, it's not *too* hard, and it would be great to have you there again."**

## Miles Prower
**"..." >>**

**"i'll think about it." >>**

**"ijust wanna go to bed, silver. see you soon" >>**

And as he sent that message, the green blip of activity transformed into a dead, dull gray.

## Silver Blure
Silver sighed, hoping to at least see him tomorrow. At this point, though, he had been lost. There was a chance he would never appear online again.

He closed his computer, not even typing a goodbye. He just sat on his bed, watching the stuff on his TV.
